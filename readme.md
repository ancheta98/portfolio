# Angel Ancheta's portfolio

## Motivation
I wanted to create something unique, in that it shows a bit about me and my human side but also shows off a bit of my technical skillset and work that I've done so far

## Mockup
### To start out I created a mock up of how I envisioned this to turn out

### These are screens of the project section on mouse hover and when a user highlights something in the nav bar
